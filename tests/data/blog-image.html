<p>Yesterday, I <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.php.net/archive/2025.php#2025-07-31-3">announced the release</a> of the last alpha version
of PHP 8.5.0, labeled <code>8.5.0alpha4</code>. This comes two weeks after the previous
version, <code>8.5.0alpha2</code>, was announced. So, what happened to <code>8.5.0alpha3</code>?</p>
<p><img src="/resources/missing-3-confusion.svg" alt="Missing alpha3 confusion" /></p>
<p>Up until the day before the announcement, the plan was for the release to be
<code>8.5.0alpha3</code>. However, there were some complications that necessitated
incorporating a few more code changes.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>The release process (from the perspective of a release manager) is essentially
split into two parts: creating an authoritative version of the code for a
release (&quot;packaging the release&quot;), and then publicizing the availability of the
release through various channels (&quot;announcing the release&quot;). The first part
requires updating a few files throughout the PHP code base, running thousands
of tests, and uploading the exact versions of the files that should be used for
the release, both to the git history of the PHP repository, and as
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://wiki.debian.org/TarBall">&quot;tarballs&quot;</a> with all of the files compressed together. Once done,
the release manager (usually) gets to take a break. This first part generally
happens on a Tuesday, two days before the release is publicly announced.</p>
<p>The tarballs contain the source code for PHP, and while you could compile that
code yourself (which is what developers do), most people probably do not want to
do that. During the two days between packaging a release and announcing it,
multiple versions of the code are compiled for various configurations so that
you can just download an executable (Windows) or install a package (*nix). The
Windows binaries are made available on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://windows.php.net/qa/">windows.php.net</a>, and for
RPM-based *nix distributions (Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, etc.) packages
are made available by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://blog.remirepo.net/post/2025/07/04/PHP-8.5-as-Software-Collection">Remi Collet</a>. For Debian-based *nix
distributions, releases will eventually be available via the
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://sury.org/">Sury repository</a>, but I'm not sure if that includes prerelease
versions like <code>8.5.0alpha4</code>.</p>
<h2>Alpha3</h2>
<p>On July 29th (Tuesday), I went through the process of packaging the
<code>8.5.0alpha3</code> release. Other than one test that timed out before completion
(and has consistently done so on my system), all of the tests passed. I created
the <code>php-8.5.0alpha3</code> git tag, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/php/php-src/releases/tag/php-8.5.0alpha3">uploaded it to the PHP repo</a>, and
created the tarballs. I then contacted the distribution list that handles
building new releases to let people know that the new version was ready to be
built.</p>
<p>When I woke up on July 30th (Wednesday), I saw messages that there were issues
with both the Windows and RPM builds for the tag. Accordingly, we needed a new
version of PHP to be tagged and built. While <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/cee8ed235af6741411ecfb93e255f10cbf85ccc1/docs/release-process.md#re-releasing-the-same-version-or-a-patch-level-ie--pln">the documentation</a>
suggests that the git tag could have just been deleted and recreated, since the
new version hadn't been announced yet, I've been told that that documentation is
outdated and that tags should be considered immutable.</p>
<h2>Alpha4</h2>
<p>As a result, I had to go through the entire process of packaging the release
again, but now with updated code that included fixes for the builds, and under
the name <code>8.5.0alpha4</code> rather than <code>8.5.0alpha3</code>. If you want to see the
difference between the two tags, you can check the
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/php/php-src/compare/php-8.5.0alpha3...php-8.5.0alpha4">comparison on GitHub</a>, since the alpha3 tag is still there in the
history.</p>
<p>The list of changed files looks big (139 files in a single day!), but most of
those changes are unrelated to fixing the build failures. The relevant fixes
were fairly small - see <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/a9f3e3c44eab1c34daf15238244cebeee40fd03f">GH-19301</a> for the RPM builds (three lines of
code changed), and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/4754d302bffc601729353984e453e88e30421425">GH-19310</a> for the Windows builds (a different
three lines of code changed). The trick is in knowing <em>which</em> three lines need
to be changed. My thanks to those who implemented the fixes so quickly!</p>
<p>The two day window between packaging and announcing the release worked exactly
as intended - it allowed for issues in the release to be caught and corrected,
so that people who wanted to actually test out the new version (which should
only be used for tests, it is <strong>not</strong> ready for production) could do so
properly.</p>
