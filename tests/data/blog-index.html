I had the
opportunity to meet with a slew of open source contributors, listen to some
amazing talks, and even present my own. <a href="/Blog/20251029-longhorn-php">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>Project Euler in Rust</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Friday, 19 September 2025</span><p>After writing the obligatory &quot;Hello, World!&quot;, I wanted to work on something
more substantial in Rust. When I learn a new programming language, my go-to
source of coding problems to try and solve in the new language is
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, which features hundreds of coding challenges of
various difficulty levels. <a href="/Blog/20250919-rust-euler">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>&quot;Hello, World!&quot; in Rust</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Friday, 12 September 2025</span><p>Yesterday, I started to teach myself how to program in Rust. As always, the first
step was a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program. <a href="/Blog/20250912-hello-world-rust">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>First Rust Patch</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Saturday, 06 September 2025</span><p>As part of preparing for my Longhorn PHP talk about what is new in PHP 8.5, I
have been going through various PHP tools and checking to what extent they
support the new features. When the support is lacking, I have sometimes tried to
add it myself; this led me to making my first patch in Rust. <a href="/Blog/20250906-mago-rust">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>Out-of-Band Signaling</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Friday, 29 August 2025</span><p>Sometimes, code needs to be able to signal an error has occurred. Perhaps some
invariant was violated. Perhaps an invalid parameter was used. Regardless of the
reason, there are two ways to signal an issue: &quot;in-band signaling&quot;, and
&quot;out-of-band signaling&quot;. <a href="/Blog/20250829-out-of-band">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>#[\DelayedTargetValidation] Attribute Explained</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Wednesday, 20 August 2025</span><p>PHP 8.5 will come with a new attribute, <code>#[\DelayedTargetValidation]</code>, that
is intended to help libraries that support running on multiple versions of PHP.
The attribute can be a bit confusing, so as the author I figured I should write
up a (hopefully helpful) guide. <a href="/Blog/20250820-delayed-target-validation">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>No PHP 8.5.0alpha3</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Friday, 01 August 2025</span><p>Yesterday, I <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.php.net/archive/2025.php#2025-07-31-3">announced the release</a> of the last alpha version
of PHP 8.5.0, labeled <code>8.5.0alpha4</code>. This comes two weeks after the previous
version, <code>8.5.0alpha2</code>, was announced. So, what happened to <code>8.5.0alpha3</code>? <a href="/Blog/20250801-no-alpha-3">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>Pygments Syntax Highlighting for Markdown</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Friday, 18 July 2025</span><p>This week, I published a new composer package that adds support for syntax
highlighting of code snippets embedded in Markdown documents. The new package
uses the Pygments highlighting library (from Python) and connects it to the
CommonMark PHP library for rendering Markdown. <a href="/Blog/20250718-pygments-highlighting">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>A Tale of Two RFCs</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Sunday, 22 June 2025</span><p>A few minutes ago, my third RFC,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/final_promotion">adding support for promoted final properties</a>, was implemented
after being approved unanimously. This comes after my second RFC,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/never-parameters-v2">adding support for <code>never</code> parameters</a>, was rejected by the
community. <a href="/Blog/20250622-two-rfcs">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>Attributes on constants</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Tuesday, 29 April 2025</span><p>Earlier today, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes-on-constants">attributes-on-constants</a> RFC implementation was finally
merged. This was a project I worked on for months and a significant reason I
became more active as a PHP core developer. The initial motivation was to add a
way for constants to be marked as deprecated, so that MediaWiki could use that
feature to signal deprecated constants instead of relying solely on
documentation. <a href="/Blog/20250429-attributes-on-constants">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>PHP 8.5 Release Manager</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Thursday, 17 April 2025</span><p>I'm honored to share that the PHP internals development community has elected
me as one of the two &quot;rookie&quot; release managers for the PHP 8.5 release cycle.
Working alongside my fellow release managers, I hope to help ensure a smooth and
successful release process. <a href="/Blog/20250417-php85-release-manager">Continue reading...</a></p></div><div class="blog-preview"><h2>Website launch</h2><span class="blog-preview-date">Wednesday, 09 April 2025</span><p>Today, I launched the initial version of my personal website (where you are most
likely reading this blog post). This marks the cumulation of over a month of
preparation and development, because I wanted to create the website myself,
rather than using a website builder like WordPress. While I do rely on a few
external libraries, the content and styles are all mine. <a href="/Blog/20250409-website-launch">Continue reading...</a></p></div></div><div class="des-footer"><div class="des-footer--content">Content is © 2025 Daniel Scherzer</div></div></body></html>
