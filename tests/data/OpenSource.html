bug fixes, improvements to the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php" target="_blank" class="external-link">Reflection extension</a> and various cleanup. In March 2025, I requested and was granted access to make
direct changes (and approve others&#039; changes) to PHP. I also became the official
maintainer of the reflection extension.</p><p>Also in March 2025, I volunteered to serve as one of the release managers for
the then-subsequent version of PHP, PHP 8.5. In April, the community voted to
decide between the volunteers (luckily there were plenty of candidates) and I
was one of the two &quot;rookie&quot; candidates chosen to help with the release. You can
read more in <a href="/Blog/20250417-php85-release-manager">my blog post</a>.</p><p>PHP uses a process of requests for comment when proposing and implementing major
changes; my RFCs include:</p><ul><li>July 2025: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecated_traits" target="_blank" class="external-link">#[\Deprecated] for traits</a> - Support the #[\Deprecated] attribute on traits (implemented in PHP 8.5)</li><li>July 2025: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/filter_throw_on_failure" target="_blank" class="external-link">FILTER_THROW_ON_FAILURE</a> - Add FILTER_THROW_ON_FAILURE flag to the filter extension (implemented in PHP 8.5)</li><li>June 2025: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/delayedtargetvalidation_attribute" target="_blank" class="external-link">#[\DelayedTargetValidation] attribute</a> - Delaying compile-time attribute target validation errors with #[\DelayedTargetValidation] (implemented in PHP 8.5)</li><li>March 2025: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/final_promotion" target="_blank" class="external-link">Final Property Promotion</a> - Adding support for final modifiers in constructor property promotion (implemented in PHP 8.5)</li><li>November 2024: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes-on-constants" target="_blank" class="external-link">Attributes on Constants</a> - Adding support for attributes on compile-time constants (implemented in PHP 8.5)</li></ul><h3 class="subsection-header">Packages</h3><p>I also wrote multiple open-source PHP packages - though they are currently
primarily used by me, I am a firm supporter of open-source code and figured that
they might be useful to others. The packages that I have created so far are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://packagist.org/packages/danielescherzer/common-phpcs" target="_blank" class="external-link">danielescherzer/common-phpcs</a> - Collection of common codesniffer standards for my projects</li><li><a href="https://packagist.org/packages/danielescherzer/commonmark-ext-pygments-highlighter" target="_blank" class="external-link">danielescherzer/commonmark-ext-pygments-highlighter</a> - CommonMark extension for code highlighting with Pygments</li><li><a href="https://packagist.org/packages/danielescherzer/html-builder" target="_blank" class="external-link">danielescherzer/html-builder</a> - Tools for building HTML</li></ul><h3 class="subsection-header">Website</h3><p>The source code for my website is also public, in case the code is useful to
others. The actual text about me is probably not going to be relevant, but my
setup, configuration, and style pages may be useful. See the code <a href="https://github.com/DanielEScherzer/website-content" target="_blank" class="external-link">here</a>.</p></div><div class="des-footer"><div class="des-footer--content">Content is © 2026 Daniel Scherzer</div></div></body></html>
